## What is data science?

"Data science is an exciting discipline that allows you to turn raw data into understanding, insight, and knowledge."

1. Capture data
2. Maintain data
3. Process data
4. Analyze data
5. Communicate data

Engineers do the first two steps (capture and maintain). **Don't worry about those.**

Statisticians do the third step (process). **Don't worry about this.**

Analysts do steps four and five (analyze and communicate). *You are already doing this!*

## What is code/programming?

- Data science heavily focuses on code.
- If you type in directions into your computer, you are coding.
    - Yes, even in Excel!
- If you are writing multiple steps of code, you are programming.
- People are use these interchangeably - you can too.

## Why code or program?

- Code is text
    - copy and paste!!
- Code is read-able
    - read your code days, weeks, months later
    - check your work/someone else's work
    - understand unfamiliar processes
- Code is share-able
    - put it on GitHub, someone can use your work
    - learn from others' work
- Code is open
    - FREE (which means inclusive)

## Why on earth would we use this for planning?

- You are around more data than you think
- Speed up repetitive processes
    - I literally received 112 Excel files this week
- Spreadsheets have limitations
- Not all data lives in spreadsheets

## Pep Talk

- This is a skill you can tackle.
- You do not need to be a genius to get it.
- You do not need to struggle on your own.
- Today, let's have the confidence of a mediocre white man.

## What is R?

- Doesn't stand for anything
- Language
- "Environment" or system
- First built for statistics
- Install packages to extend R

## Why use R over other options?

- Easy to install (unlike Python)
- Easy to install packages (unlike Python)
- Easy to keep updated (unlike Python)
- Language is easy to read
- Great at building charts and graphs
- **R has a fantastic community for women.**

## Installing R

- We're downloading the R system
- Download here: <https://cloud.r-project.org/>
- Follow the defaults

## Installing R Studio Desktop

- We're downloading software that makes R easy to use.
- Download here: <https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download>

## R Studio Layout

## Install `tidyverse`
- Packages are installed from CRAN (where you downloaded R)
- Documentation is available on CRAN and GitHub
    - The GitHub documentation is almost always better
    - Might be called "vignettes" or "READMEs"
- `tidyverse` is a package of multiple packages
- we are using `readr` and `dplyr` today

```{r install, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
install.packages("tidyverse")
```

## Load `tidyverse`

```{r import, echo = TRUE}
library(tidyverse)
```
- You can also use `library()` to see all of your installed packages

## Find our working directory

```{r getwd, echo = TRUE}
getwd()
```
- Working directory can (and should) be changed with each project
- We're not going to get into this today
- Learn more here later

## Download today's data
- List of Certified Business Enterprises, or contracting businesses that get preferred opportunities from the DC Gov
- Download from GitHub repo
- Originally from OpenDataDC
- Save where your working directory is

## Import data
- We'll use the `read_csv()` function
- A function has a name and arguments
- ? in front of a function opens a help window that explains the function and its arguments
    - I use this constantly.
- `<-` means "assign" or "create". The object name on the left becomes whatever is on the right side


```{r help, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
?read_csv

```

```{r import_data, echo = TRUE}
raw_data <- read_csv("Certified_Business_Enterprise.csv")
```

## Look at data, example 1
- Many ways to look at data
- Column Names
- Column Types
- Organization

```{r view_data, echo = TRUE}
raw_data

```

## Look at data, example 2

```{r view_data2, echo = TRUE}
head(raw_data)

```


### Look at data, example 3

```{r view_data3, echo = TRUE}
glimpse(raw_data)

```

## Analyze data
- Sample analysis time!
- Goal: count how many CBEs are in Ward 8 by year established and export
- Uses functions from `dplyr`
- It is okay if we don't get `through all of these
- Saved on GitHub for later

## Filter
- Select just Ward 8
- Uses two equal signs
- `%>%` is called a pipe and is part of `tidyverse`
    - Read it as "and then"
```{r filter, echo = TRUE}
sample_data <- raw_data %>%
  filter(WARD == 8)

head(sample_data)
```

## Arrange
- Arrange A-Z or smallest to largest
- `arrange(desc(BUSINESSNAME)) would be descending

```{r arrange, echo = TRUE}
sample_data_1 <- sample_data %>%
  arrange(BUSINESSNAME)

head(sample_data_1)
```

## Select
- Select only the columns we want
```{r select, echo = TRUE}
sample_data_2 <- sample_data_1 %>%
  select(BUSINESSNAME, PRINCIPALOWNER, DATEESTABLISHED)

head(sample_data_2)
```

## Mutate
- Add a new column
- `substr()` lets you pick which characters you want (you don't have to understand this today)
```{r mutate, echo = TRUE}
sample_data_3 <- sample_data_2 %>%
  mutate(year = substr(DATEESTABLISHED, 1, 4))

head(sample_data_3)
```

## Group By and Summarize
- Group By creates groups of rows with the same values
- Summarize does whatever summary you want within the group
```{r group_by, echo = TRUE}
sample_data_4 <- sample_data_3 %>%
  group_by(year) %>%
  summarize(n())

head(sample_data_4)
```

## Export data
- Similar to `read_csv()`
- First tell it which data frame you want
- Then tell it the name of the file
```{r export, echo = TRUE}
write_csv(sample_data_4, "CBE_by_year.csv")
```
