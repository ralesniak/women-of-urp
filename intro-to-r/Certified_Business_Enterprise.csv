Sol Systems aggregates diverse capital sources to provide a synthetic financing source for developers of commercial solar projects in the U.S. and Canada. The company first entered the market providing the first long-term contracts for solar renewable energy credits (SRECs), a commodity-based incentive that is essential for financing solar on the East Coast. Before Sol Systems was founded, SREC markets were reserved for large, utility-scale projects. It was difficult for homeowners and small businesses to monetize SRECs because of the transaction costs associated with smaller systems. Sol Systems revolutionized SREC markets by aggregating SRECs from thousands of small system owners and then selling them into contracts with energy suppliers, who needed to purchase them to meet state law. In 2011, Sol Systems began focusing on commercial solar, the sector of the solar market with the lowest historical growth due to high transaction costs and a lack of capital. Today, Sol Systems has evolved to offer solar developers access a full suite of solar financing products, including construction and term debt, sponsor and tax equity, full purchase financing, and SREC solutions. Sol Systems also provides developer partners with market information and guidance on best practices to increase the likelihood that a project will receive financing. One of the biggest issues in the industry is fragmented investment channels that create friction in the market. By pooling these together, Sol Systems serves as a conduit of capital and investment opportunities for the industrys investors and developers. The firm has facilitated financing for over 90 MW of solar energy, enough to provide clean, green electricity to approximately 10,500 homes, promoting U.S. energy independence and increasing solar deployment.",,1101 CONNECTICUT AVENUE NW WASHINGTON DC 20036 ,true,"Local Business Enterprise (LBE);Small Business Enterprise (SBE);Resident Owned Business (ROB);",241795,396553.43,137353.65,38.9040321256402,-77.0397349708273

Our mission is straightforward: create tools, products and services that people love AND enable healthier, more sustainable communities at the same time. Our first (and currently primary) line of business is Compost Cab, a pioneer in the area of community composting. Compost Cab exists to do two things: make it easier for people to compost, and make it easier for urban agriculture to thrive. In pursuit of these weve created a closed-loop, farm-to-table-to-farm model for others to follow. Our residential pickup service makes it easy for individuals and families to compost in and around the city. People sign up online. We deliver them a customized 5-6-gallon collection bin, and our subscribers fill the bin with food scraps suitable for on-farm urban composting. We then work with a series of small local, mostly not-for-profit farms, using our subscribers food scraps to help build new soil in and around the city. Twice per year, our subscribers are eligible to receive soil for their gardens, or they can donate their compost to one of our not-for-profit partners – were proud that around half of our subscribers choose to donate. To manage this growing business, weve developed proprietary software, including a web-based mobile application that allows us to gain granular insight into our subscribers composting. In turn, this enables us to improve activation and usage over time. We expect to license our program for the first time in 2017. In our effort to expand access to composting across the city, we partner with farmers markets, schools, and other organizations to promote composting, zero-waste, and sustainability in general. These services fall broadly under the umbrella of “sustainability consulting,” an area we expect to grow rapidly, and be ripe for disruption, for years to come.",,1133 15TH STREET NW WASHINGTON DC 20005 ,true,"Local Business Enterprise (LBE);Small Business Enterprise (SBE);Development Enterprise Zone (DZE);Resident Owned Business (ROB);",240246,397049.04,137444.64,38.9048535990535,-77.0340215515466

Organizations that are able to show results can deliver better and more cost-efficient services and be more marketable to funders looking for outcome achievement rather than quantity of efforts. Navigating this increasingly results-oriented environment requires focus on monitoring and evaluation (M&E) and dedication to using results for program improvement. Organisations making decisions based on data and analytics hold a sustainable competitive advantage over others; they have a better understanding of the current program conditions and the ability to plan for future service improvement to increase the impact of the Organisation. We believe that effective programs rely on three core pillars: people, process and structure. Organisations need talented people with the skill-sets to excel at their jobs, processes that increase efficiencies and a structure that encourages data-backed decision-making. 2) Social and Environmental Impact; Before undertaking large projects, an organisation must first ensure that requirements have been met to satisfy local and national regulations. This often involves a social impact assessment as well as a consultation with the public that may be affected by the project. Here at Institute for Development Impact we begin our approach with a thorough examination of the proposed project and its impact both socially and environmentally.

The philosophy is to work tirelessly with clients to help them achieve their desired outcomes and triumph over the issues that brought them to us. The goal of community-based programs in this model is to carefully work with naturally occurring units of solution as our units of practice, or where and how we choose to intervene. This necessitates a careful assessment of community structures and processes, in advance, of any intervention. It also requires an insiders understanding of the community to identify and work with these naturally occurring units of solution to address community problems. Thus, the aim is to strengthen these units of solution to better meet the needs of community members. This approach may include strengthening community through neighborhood organizations and network linkages, including informal social networks, ties between individuals and the organizations that serve them, and connections among community organizations to strengthen their ability to collaborate. The model also necessitates addressing issues of common concern for the community, many or most of which are not directly health issues.

For example, breakfast options feature grass-fed meats and cage free eggs (e.g., whole grain pancakes, French toast, fresh seasonal fruits, whole grain hot cereals, breads, muffins and pastries). During lunch, the fare will include fresh soups, house-made burgers, signature sandwiches, smoothies, garden fresh seasonal salads with homemade and nutritious dressings, signature pies, cakes and cookies, and locally inspired beverages. Only three of the more than 30 farmers markets in the District of Columbia are located east of the Anacostia River. NSL has entered into an agreement with DMPED to provide 10 hours of programming each month at Gateway DC and/or the R.I.S.E. Demonstration Center. The programs (nutrition counseling, basic food handling, cooking classes, and interactive food demonstrations) will be offered in a state-of-the-art teaching kitchen at low or no-cost to the public. To support this effort, NSL will utilize Ms. Bailey-Joyners previous experience as well as a consultant with considerable expertise in developing successful community mapping and outreach programs focused on improving access to healthy food options. More than 6,000 employees at the St. Elizabeths campus will purchase fresh snacks and meals from MSC, the only full-service restaurant in the St. Elizabeths East Gateway Pavilion. This inviting and historic183-acre campus setting will also serve as a gathering place that provides information, free Wi-Fi services, offer guests a library with more than 1,000 books and during the evening hours cooking demonstrations to help individuals make incremental but critical changes to their diet and food choices.
