### ArcGIS
*(April 13, 2018)*
I find ArcGIS both exciting and overwhelming. These are three skills I’ve learned in the past year that immediately improved my maps.
Beginner - [Joining Census Data to Shapefiles](http://spatial.scholarslab.org/stepbystep/joining-census-data-tables-to-shapefiles-in-arcmap/): This is an essential skill. If you don't know how to do this, bookmark this page. 

Novice - [Maplex Labeling Engine](http://desktop.arcgis.com/en/arcmap/10.5/map/working-with-text/introduction-to-the-maplex-tutorial.htm): Sometimes, labels in ArcGIS look perfect as-is. Most of the time... not so much. Maplex Labeling Engine is your new best friend. 

Intermediate - [Data Driven Pages](http://desktop.arcgis.com/en/arcmap/10.5/map/page-layouts/what-are-data-driven-pages-.htm): This game-changing tool makes maps of multiple areas without duplicating your map files or layers. 

[Here's](http://stip.wemovedc.org/wp-content/uploads/STIP_OpenHouse_Boards_2017-10-02.pdf) an example of how I've used data-driven pages at work. I made DC ward maps and only showed features that were in the wards. The labeling was done using the Maplex engine. (Scroll to page 3 in this large-ish PDF, sorry!)

Bonus: If you’ve already graduated and can’t renew your ArcGIS student license, try the open-source version called [QGIS](https://www.qgis.org/en/site/).


### Microsoft Office 
*(March 16, 2018)*

I am passionate about learning new skills that make us capable women, driven to soak up knowledge rather than relying on (sometimes sub-par) on-the-job training or limited university teaching. I'm hoping that I can help find resources for lots of skills that might be needed in our planning or planning-adjacent careers and share them in the newsletter and in person. For this newsletter, I've found four Lynda tutorials that give new skills or enhance existing ones in Microsoft Office, which is software no one can escape! On deck for the next newsletter: ArcGIS.


Using your Georgetown ID, you can download [Microsoft Office 365](https://georgetown.onthehub.com/WebStore/Welcome.aspx) for free and access Lynda.com

[Microsoft Word: Long Documents](https://www.lynda.com/Office-tutorials/Word-2013-Creating-Long-Documents/167073-2.html?org=georgetown.edu) If you're going to make a 100+ page planning document, you'll definitely need to know how to make cross-references, table of contents, and section breaks.

[Microsoft Excel: Introduction to Formulas and Functions](https://www.lynda.com/Excel-tutorials/Excel-2016-Introduction-Formulas-Functions/576587-2.html?org=georgetown.edu) Even if you have experience with Excel, you'll learn something from this course. Can't believe I never heard of SUMIF before...

[Microsoft Access: Essential Training](https://www.lynda.com/Access-tutorials/Access-2013-Essential-Training/115857-2.html?org=georgetown.edu) Access is a secret powerhouse very few understand. Make a goal of finishing Sections 1-5 + 9 (but you get a gold star if you get through the whole thing!) If you want to talk about Access and its applications to urban planning, feel free to email me. I may also do a training on that in the future. 

[Accessibility in Microsoft Office](https://www.lynda.com/Office-tutorials/Creating-Accessible-Documents-Microsoft-Office/614288-2.html?org=georgetown.edu) People with vision, hearing, or movement impairments are often forgotten about when creating documents. If you're making a public-facing Word, Excel, or PowerPoint document, take the time to make your document accessible.
