## Archive of Skills Resources from Newsletter

### Microsoft Office (March 16, 2018)

I am passionate about learning new skills that make us capable women, driven to soak up knowledge rather than relying on (sometimes sub-par) on-the-job training or limited university teaching. I'm hoping that I can help find resources for lots of skills that might be needed in our planning or planning-adjacent careers and share them in the newsletter and in person. For this newsletter, I've found four Lynda tutorials that give new skills or enhance existing ones in Microsoft Office, which is software no one can escape! On deck for the next newsletter: ArcGIS.


Using your Georgetown ID, you can download [Microsoft Office 365](https://georgetown.onthehub.com/WebStore/Welcome.aspx) for free and access Lynda.com

[Microsoft Word: Long Documents](https://www.lynda.com/Office-tutorials/Word-2013-Creating-Long-Documents/167073-2.html?org=georgetown.edu) If you're going to make a 100+ page planning document, you'll definitely need to know how to make cross-references, table of contents, and section breaks.

[Microsoft Excel: Introduction to Formulas and Functions](https://www.lynda.com/Excel-tutorials/Excel-2016-Introduction-Formulas-Functions/576587-2.html?org=georgetown.edu) Even if you have experience with Excel, you'll learn something from this course. Can't believe I never heard of SUMIF before...

[Microsoft Access: Essential Training](https://www.lynda.com/Access-tutorials/Access-2013-Essential-Training/115857-2.html?org=georgetown.edu) Access is a secret powerhouse very few understand. Make a goal of finishing Sections 1-5 + 9 (but you get a gold star if you get through the whole thing!) If you want to talk about Access and its applications to urban planning, feel free to email me. I may also do a training on that in the future. 

[Accessibility in Microsoft Office](https://www.lynda.com/Office-tutorials/Creating-Accessible-Documents-Microsoft-Office/614288-2.html?org=georgetown.edu) People with vision, hearing, or movement impairments are often forgotten about when creating documents. If you're making a public-facing Word, Excel, or PowerPoint document, take the time to make your document accessible.
