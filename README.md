### Resumes and Cover Letters
*(June 21, 2019)*

Lots of my thoughts are inspired by Alison Green at AskaManager.org. Read her advice on [resumes](https://www.thecut.com/article/how-to-make-a-resume.html) and [cover letters](https://www.thecut.com/article/how-to-write-a-cover-letter.html). She also has a ton of [archives](https://www.askamanager.org/category/resumes) about [both](https://www.askamanager.org/category/cover-letters). 

* **Resumes** should be a summary of your accomplishments - not your job duties. Employers are looking for the things you did that made yourself valuable, like how you were the most productive intern ever, the skills you learned to make your work more efficient, or the fresh ideas you implemented. Don’t try to squeeze things in - think about what is most important and highlight that.

* **Cover Letters** are not a rehashing of your resume. Instead, every sentence should be about why you would be good at the job. What qualities do you get praised for? What excites you about the job position?  Here are three sentences I wrote about my data skills that paint a picture of my value:

  * My managers have lauded me for my ability to find efficient ways to collect, store, and present data on projects that would be messy without it. On top of my technical skills, I have an ingrained sensitivity to how the approach of a presentation should account for an audience's needs, knowledge, and familiarity with the topic. I am complimented often on how clear my final products are, even when they contain technical content.

* Keep the tone of your cover letters **professionally conversational**. There’s no need to write like you don’t have a personality. I like to think of it as the tone I use with my current boss - we’re not friends, but she also knows I’m a human being.

* Unless you’re a graphic designer, keep the design of both documents **boring**. Make the content creative and polished - but easily skimmable. [Georgetown has a great template](https://careercenter.georgetown.edu/major-career-guides/resumes-cover-letters/resume-formatting-tips/), but there’s no need for buying resume paper.

* You’ll catch most errors by **reading out loud**. Better yet, have someone else read your documents out loud to you! 

### Coding/Data Science
*(October 19, 2018)*

I can’t stop talking about coding! Even out for drinks a couple of weeks ago, all I could do was gush about the progress I made in R. I strongly recommend giving it a shot even if you have no expectation to become an expert or jump into a data analyst role. 

* Why code? Hadley Wickham, a big name in R, gives a talk about [why all statistics students should learn to program](https://speakerdeck.com/hadley/should-all-statistics-students-be-programmers) -- but not be programmers. I think it should be extended - if you work with data, you should learn enough programming to make your life easier. [Here’s a video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpbtcsGE0OA) of a similar talk about why data science is best coded, not point-and-click.

* Why learn R? R was built for statisticians and has evolved into an easy-to-approach language that even the humanities uses. You can have literally no training in computer science and succeed using R. R makes it easy to do data analysis necessary for all fields of urban planning. You can even do spatial analyses using shapefiles! The introduction I recommend most is [R for Data Science](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/).

* Why learn Python? - Python can do a lot of what R does, but its goal is often creating tools over doing analysis. Additionally, Python is the language needed to do advanced ArcGIS work. I haven’t delved into Python yet, but when I do, I’m very interested in [Automate the Boring Stuff](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/), a web-book chock full of practical ways to use Python to speed up, well, the boring stuff of using a computer. 

* Why not use VBA? Visual Basic (or macros in Excel) is essential for using the most advanced features in Excel. But because it only lives in Excel, it’s less flexible than R, Python, or other data analysis languages. Learning R or Python allows you to work with Excel spreadsheets and other data sources, like shapefiles and web connections (APIs). Additionally, Excel has a size limit that makes it very aggravating to use… it’s actually a primary reason I started to learn R!

* Why not use C++/Java/HTML/CSS/etc.? These languages have their uses, but if you’re learning them, you’re probably not doing urban planning work. If you want to be a software developer or web designer, these are essential!

* How do I get started? - Watch the videos! Read those books! Join Data Camp and pick a track! [Follow](https://twitter.com/BecomingDataSci) [some](https://twitter.com/dataandme) [wonderful](https://twitter.com/JennyBryan) [women](https://twitter.com/juliasilge) [on](https://twitter.com/minebocek) [Twitter](https://twitter.com/sharlagelfand)! Find the data science meetups available in DC. When you come across something you’re interested but don’t understand yet, bookmark it. Google your questions! Most importantly, download R Studio or Anaconda and start typing!

### General Data Skills
*(October 5, 2018)*

Thinking about data: Sure, technical skills are great, but thinking about what data is telling us is so important. A great example of critically thinking about datasets is at [Chartable](https://blog.datawrapper.de/weekly46-consumer-price-index/) (Rachel’s current blog crush).

Data doesn’t have to mean code: While I am personally super-empowered by learning R, I know that others don’t need it, don’t want to learn it, or are intimidated to dive in. Instead, get a refresher on using spreadsheets using [this free Data Camp course](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/data-analysis-with-spreadsheets), and learn how they’ve transformed business through this [Planet Money episode from 2015](https://www.npr.org/sections/money/2015/02/25/389027988/episode-606-spreadsheets).

Best practices for using spreadsheets: While spreadsheets are used universally, how they are set up can vary wildly… Learn [best practices](https://www.benlcollins.com/spreadsheets/data-best-practices/) and make your spreadsheets as useful as possible (not landmine fields of merged cells, color coding, and tables-within-tables)

But where do I even find data?: I’m finding lots of new datasets on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets)! You can always find US demographic information at American FactFinder, and transportation data is available at the National Transit Database. You’ll also learn that data exists if you read blogs and news stories about the topics that interest you the most.

### Taking the AICP Exam
*(June 15, 2018) from Ari Koudounas*

Last month I took and passed the certification exam with the American Institute of Certified Planners (AICP). To help pay forward the valuable information shared with me as I prepared  for the exam, here are a few guiding lights as you consider if/when/how to take it yourself: 

* [Basic Information I wish I knew earlier than I did](https://www.planning.org/certification/bulletin/): there are requirements based on your level of education/work experience. Check out the exam guide linked in the title to see where you fall. I needed three years of experience in my case and fortunately could count a lot of work experience I had prior to acquiring my planning degree that was allowed to count towards it. For those of you still in school, keep in mind that internships can also count towards this experience total. 

* Test Format and Scoring : The exam is all multiple choice, on a computer at a testing center, and contains 170 multiple choice questions. 20 of these questions are always “practice” questions that do not count/are being tested for a future exam, so you’re only getting scored on 150 questions (but you don’t know which are the practice questions). As such, a passing grade is roughly 110/150 (which really means 130/170) correct. Good to keep in mind as you’re assessing yourself in practice exams leading up to the test. 

* [Know the deadlines and details for registering](https://www.planning.org/certification/currentexam/): the exam is offered twice per year. You must apply to take the exam, and that application is due several months before the exam. You’ll find the information for the upcoming deadline (June 28) in the link provided in this bullet’s title for the November 2018 exam. Note: if you submit by the early bird deadline (which unfortunately has already passed for this round - June 7) APA will give you feedback on your application in case you had some errors. I would strongly recommend submitting by the early bird deadline for this reason. There are three rather involved questions you must answer, in addition to submitting letters of recommendation, transcripts, etc. - so best to do what’s in your control to submit the strongest application possible.   

* [Expose yourself to all of the resources for preparing](https://www.planning.org/certification/examprep/): the link shared in the title is APA’s general page for AICP prep resources. I personally chose not to pay for a prep course, but I did commit well over 100 hours over the past several months to studying. I really thought of it as “cross-training” in the sense that I prepared in so many different ways --- flashcards, a big study board I rolled out in my apartment to feed my more visually-minded brain, practice questions and practice tests, subject-based webinars, etc. I am happy to discuss all of this at length with those interested. 

Free online resources to get you started: 

* This is an amazing, exhaustive, [90-page PDF of links](http://www.floridaplanning.org/treasurecoast/aicp_links.pdf) to prepare for the exam, provided by the Florida APA chapter 

* [Planning Prep](http://www.planningprep.com/) has a ton of practice questions and practice tests. While some of their questions are outdated (the test questions were asking about the 2000 rather than the 2010 Census, for example), it’s very helpful in general, especially since it will time you on taking the exam / give you analytics on how long you took per question on average and the % of questions you got incorrect, etc. 

* [Quizlet](https://quizlet.com/7771414/aicp-exam-prep-flash-cards/) has a bunch of AICP flashcards by categories that the exam covers, which I found especially helpful for getting the law cases further engrained. 


### Presenting Skills
*(May 25, 2018)*

Visual: 

[Better Presentations by Jon Schwabish](http://www.jstor.org.proxy.library.georgetown.edu/stable/10.7312/schw17520): If you follow this, your presentations really will be better. I took the idea of “layering” to heart and it made really heavy data sections super clear. It’s available as an eBook through the GU Library -- but alums should pony up the money anyway

[SlidesCarnival](https://www.slidescarnival.com/category/free-templates): free PowerPoint or Google Slides templates. I like these because she gives you ideas for layouts and presenting your information, not just colors and fonts.

Audio:

I will always talk quickly. To calm myself down, I found some songs that have a slow Beats per Minute (BPM) and sang them to myself. Find some songs around [60-80 BPM here](https://jog.fm/workout-songs-by-bpm).

This [post on pacing](https://medium.com/@speakerhubHQ/your-speech-pace-guide-to-speeding-and-slowing-down-be150dcb9cd7) has implementable practice strategies.

### Writing Skills
*(May 11, 2018)*

Writing feels like a skill you should already have from your 20+ years of schooling -- yet, writing well is rare, and it takes being uncomfortable to grow at it.

#### Academic Writing

How-To for Chicago Manual of Style: I gave a presentation on the Chicago Manual of Style. You can find the [slide deck here](https://docs.google.com/a/georgetown.edu/viewer?a=v&pid=sites&srcid=Z2VvcmdldG93bi5lZHV8dGhlLXVycC10b3duLXNxdWFyZXxneDo2Yzc2YzhjNjRmMzQ5N2M2). (This is on the URP Town Square, so be signed in to your georgetown.edu account)

How to Write a BA Thesis: Writing your thesis is hard! If you haven't started thinking about it, [I suggest this book to get started](http://www.charleslipson.com/How-to-write-a-thesis.htm).

Zotero: It’s not worth the investment to use a citation manager on shorter papers, but for your thesis work, it helps keep everything organized. I use [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/), but like every citation manager, it's not perfect. For best results, download the desktop software, browser connector, and Microsoft Word plug-in. 

SCS Writing Center: The [writing center](http://scswritinglab.georgetown.domains/) is always advertised like it’s only for remedial students, but I believe every Georgetown student should take advantage of it. Sharla is super nice and helped me find parts of my thesis that were unclear.

#### General Writing

Grammarly: [Grammarly](https://www.grammarly.com/) is like having a pocket editor - it does way more than spell check. If you don't want to download more software, [this blog from Grammarly](https://www.grammarly.com/blog/5-ways-to-write-concisely/) may inspire you to change your sentence structure.

Improve your emails: I like a lot of the concepts [in this blog post](https://hbr.org/2016/11/how-to-write-email-with-military-precision) about how the military writes emails, and HBR translates them into business-friendly approaches. I’ll be thrilled if you take point 3: Be economical to heart.

### Software to Learn
*(April 27, 2018)*

Looking for something *brand new* to learn this summer? Try one of these software programs:

Tableau: Tableau is a data exploration and visualization tool, and it offers a [free student license](https://www.tableau.com/academic/students). The software is easy to use and infinite in its possibilities. Read [Tableau's blog post](https://www.tableau.com/about/blog/2017/8/3-steps-make-most-your-free-student-license-75791) to get started with your free license. You can also use [Tableau Public](https://public.tableau.com/en-us/s/) to create dashboards in your browser - no license needed!

SketchUp: I'll admit, I know nothing about SketchUp and likely will not need to. If I did need to learn it, [this 26-hour "learning path" from Lynda](https://www.lynda.com/learning-paths/CAD/improve-your-sketchup-skills) would be my starting point.

R: My post-thesis to-do list includes learning R, which is used for statistics and data analysis. I'm going to tackle the [Data Analyst with R career track](https://www.datacamp.com/tracks/data-analyst-with-r) at DataCamp. I’ve been following [R-Bloggers](https://www.r-bloggers.com/) to learn practical applications.

### ArcGIS
*(April 13, 2018)*

I find ArcGIS both exciting and overwhelming. These are three skills I’ve learned in the past year that immediately improved my maps.

Beginner - [Joining Census Data to Shapefiles](http://spatial.scholarslab.org/stepbystep/joining-census-data-tables-to-shapefiles-in-arcmap/): This is an essential skill. If you don't know how to do this, bookmark this page. 

Novice - [Maplex Labeling Engine](http://desktop.arcgis.com/en/arcmap/10.5/map/working-with-text/introduction-to-the-maplex-tutorial.htm): Sometimes, labels in ArcGIS look perfect as-is. Most of the time... not so much. Maplex Labeling Engine is your new best friend. 

Intermediate - [Data Driven Pages](http://desktop.arcgis.com/en/arcmap/10.5/map/page-layouts/what-are-data-driven-pages-.htm): This game-changing tool makes maps of multiple areas without duplicating your map files or layers. 

[Here's](http://stip.wemovedc.org/wp-content/uploads/STIP_OpenHouse_Boards_2017-10-02.pdf) an example of how I've used data-driven pages at work. I made DC ward maps and only showed features that were in the wards. The labeling was done using the Maplex engine. (Scroll to page 3 in this large-ish PDF, sorry!)

Bonus: If you’ve already graduated and can’t renew your ArcGIS student license, try the open-source version called [QGIS](https://www.qgis.org/en/site/).


### Microsoft Office 
*(March 16, 2018)*

I am passionate about learning new skills that make us capable women, driven to soak up knowledge rather than relying on (sometimes sub-par) on-the-job training or limited university teaching. I'm hoping that I can help find resources for lots of skills that might be needed in our planning or planning-adjacent careers and share them in the newsletter and in person. For this newsletter, I've found four Lynda tutorials that give new skills or enhance existing ones in Microsoft Office, which is software no one can escape! On deck for the next newsletter: ArcGIS.


Using your Georgetown ID, you can download [Microsoft Office 365](https://georgetown.onthehub.com/WebStore/Welcome.aspx) for free and access [Lynda.com](https://www.library.georgetown.edu/lynda).

[Microsoft Word: Long Documents](https://www.lynda.com/Office-tutorials/Word-2013-Creating-Long-Documents/167073-2.html?org=georgetown.edu) If you're going to make a 100+ page planning document, you'll definitely need to know how to make cross-references, table of contents, and section breaks.

[Microsoft Excel: Introduction to Formulas and Functions](https://www.lynda.com/Excel-tutorials/Excel-2016-Introduction-Formulas-Functions/576587-2.html?org=georgetown.edu) Even if you have experience with Excel, you'll learn something from this course. Can't believe I never heard of SUMIF before...

[Microsoft Access: Essential Training](https://www.lynda.com/Access-tutorials/Access-2013-Essential-Training/115857-2.html?org=georgetown.edu) Access is a secret powerhouse very few understand. Make a goal of finishing Sections 1-5 + 9 (but you get a gold star if you get through the whole thing!) If you want to talk about Access and its applications to urban planning, feel free to email me. I may also do a training on that in the future. 

[Accessibility in Microsoft Office](https://www.lynda.com/Office-tutorials/Creating-Accessible-Documents-Microsoft-Office/614288-2.html?org=georgetown.edu) People with vision, hearing, or movement impairments are often forgotten about when creating documents. If you're making a public-facing Word, Excel, or PowerPoint document, take the time to make your document accessible.
